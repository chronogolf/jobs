# The Chronogolf Challenge

## Guidelines

**The challenge is an Angular application that manages Palindromes. Complete this application by following the instructions in each step.**

## Steps

1. Implement the behaviour to add palindromes to the list. It should only accept palindromes (No complex validation or error handling required).

2. Implement the behaviour to delete a palidrome from the list.

3. Implement the select and unselect behaviour for list items. The text of the selected palindrome should be displayed in the primary color of the application.

4. Update the primary color from green to red `#ed5153` and improve the layout of the list items by aligning the delete button on the right.

5. Implement the filter behaviour so that the list items are filtered by the inputed text, the list should be updated as you type.

## What is a Palindrome?

> A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam or racecar... [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome)

For our application we will only supports basic palindrome: alphabetic characters, spaces and dashes.

### Some Palindromes

- Madam
- Race car
- Pull-up

## The Angular commands

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

### Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

Good luck!
