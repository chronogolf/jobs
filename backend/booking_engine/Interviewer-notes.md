## Intro to Building a Booking Engine

As you interview, be mindful of the following things overall:

- Is the candidate receptive to feedback?
- Did the candidate showcase any toxic or inappropriate behaviour?
- Will the candidate be interested in the work and culture we can provide?

<br/>

## The Challenge

<br/>

### Step 1 - Create a new reservation

What we want to assess/think about:

- Is the candidate capable of asking relevant questions?
- Does the candidate have essential notions of OOP?
- Are they capable of focusing on a small scope and/or breaking down problems?

<br/>

### Step 2 - Validate reservations are 10 minutes apart

What we want to assess/think about:

- Is the candidate able to build upon previous understanding and code?
- Is the candidate organizing their thoughts and code clearly?
- If they get "stuck", is the candidate able to research (google, asking the interviewer) in a productive way?

<br/>

### Step 3 - Validate same-player reservations are 2 hours apart

What we want to assess/think about:

- Is the candidate able to search for core APIs behaviour?
- Has the candidate introduced regressions at this stage of the challenge that you can maneuver them to address?
- Have you discussed testing or has the candidate outlined some test cases?

<br/>

### Step 4 - API Design

What we want to assess/think about:

- Can the candidate design simple systems?
- Does the candidate have previous experience with building APIs?

<br/>

### Step 5 - Scalability

What we want to assess/think about:

- Can the candidate think about more advanced architectural concerns?
- Does the candidate have previous experience in scalability?
  OR
- Is the candidate asking relevant questions to try to formulate an answer to a complex problem they don't know yet?
