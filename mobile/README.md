# The Chronogolf Challenge

## Part 1

You just got feedback from our client about our app being slow.
We would like for you to take a look at the code and help us find what could be improved to make our app faster and more responsive.

Code available on [NS Playground]()

## Part 2

Now that our app has been adopted widely, we are struggling to keep every user on the last version, which prevents us from keeping a small and simple API.
We would like for you to add a new feature to the app, allowing to check for updates on the store, and then offer to download it if available.

Good luck!
