# Lightspeed Subscriptions challenge

Step 1: BE Test

- We recently pushed some modifications to our code and one of our tests is failing. Please fix it :)

To run the test command: `npm run test`

You can access the Swagger interface on the following URL
`http://localhost:3000/api/#/`

- We've recently received the request to integrate our service to the ecom API (see `src/___mocks___` directory).
  Our implementation only allows the Retail API integration.
  Please write the required modifications to the actual code to support this.

- Feel free to add new or update some existing specs as you see fit

Step 2: Open Questions
